### **M2: Feature Engineering & Explainability**

Objective: Build a feature engineering pipeline with explainability visualizations.

Tasks:

**Feature Engineering:**
 - Implement preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or transformations.

**Explainability:**
- Use an open-source explainability library (e.g., SHAP, LIME, or InterpretML) to illustrate how each feature affects the class.
- Use insights from explainability to refine the feature engineering pipeline.

**Deliverables:**
- Feature engineering pipeline code.
- Explainability visualizations and analysis.
- Justification of selected features based on explainability results.

"""### **Justification of Selected Features Based on Explainability Results**  

#### **1. Feature Importance & Selection Criteria**  
Based on the SHAP summary plot, the **top-ranked features** (e.g., Feature 45, Feature 37, Feature 46, etc.) have the **highest impact on model predictions**. These features contribute significantly to distinguishing between multiple classes, making them crucial for accurate classification.  

We selected features based on the following criteria:  
- **High SHAP value**: Features with **higher SHAP values contribute more** to model decisions and should be retained.  
- **Multi-class relevance**: Features that **impact multiple classes** (e.g., Feature 45 affects Class 6 and Class 7 significantly) are **more valuable** than those impacting only one class.  
- **Feature redundancy**: If two features have **similar contributions**, one may be removed to reduce dimensionality without losing predictive power.  

#### **2. Retained Features**  
We retained the **top 20 features** because they provide the **most significant contributions** across different classes. These features are necessary for model interpretability and performance.  

#### **3. Dropped Features**  
- Features with **low SHAP values** (bottom-ranked in the plot) contribute minimally to predictions.  
- **Redundant features** that share similar importance distributions with top-ranked features were considered for removal.  

#### **4. Next Steps for Feature Engineering**  
- **Transformations**: Apply **scaling or normalization** to top features to ensure consistent impact.  
- **Dimensionality reduction**: Consider **PCA or feature selection techniques** to remove redundant features.  
- **Class-wise feature tuning**: If some features are highly class-specific, consider targeted preprocessing for those features.  

### **Conclusion**  
By leveraging explainability insights from SHAP, we refined our feature selection process to retain **high-impact features** while eliminating **low-contribution ones**. This results in a **more efficient, interpretable, and accurate model**. ðŸš€
